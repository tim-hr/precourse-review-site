    <h2>Why we like the command line</h2>
    <p>Recall why we like Unix and working on the command line.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unix is a powerful, programmer-friendly operating system. (It’s the basis of Mac OS X.)</li>
      <li>Unix has many small, useful built-in commands and tools.</li>
      <li>The command line (also known as the terminal) offers us easy access to these handy commands.</li>
      <li>The command line gives you the power to automate some of your programming tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Some basic Unix commands</h2>
